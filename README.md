# whiteboard-arm
Playground for writing on a whiteboard using a robot arm and Viam

This uses a 3d-printed custom spring-loaded marker/eraser holder to write on a pane of glass.

The plane of the glass pane is dynamically generated by specifying three points on the glass, and the correct motions to write on it are derived from that.

This is able to write the word "VIAM", and also is able to write and dynamically update the time formatted using standard seven-segment digits.

You probably shouldn't use this as-is, but feel free to take inspiration from the code
